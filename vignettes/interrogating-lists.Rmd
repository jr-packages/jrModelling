```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Introduction

Many of the standard statistical functions that we use in R return a collection
of model diagnostics that does not fit naturally into a single data frame. For
example, suppose we carry out a simple one-sided $t$-test

```{r, }
t.test(z)
``` 

\noindent The R output returns:

- the test statistic: `m_stats[1]`
- the degrees of freedom: `r m_stats[2]`
- the $p$-value: `r m_stats[3]`
- the confidence interval: (`r m_stats[4]`, `r m_stats[5]`). 

When performing $\chi^2$ tests, amongst other things, the output contains
expected and observed values. In this chapter, we will investigate how to
programmatically access these objects.

## An R list

An R list is an object consisting of an ordered collection of (possibly
different) objects known as its components. For example, a list could consist of
a numeric vector and a data frame. To create a list, we use the `list` function

```{r, }
lst = list(course = "modelling", no_of_partipants = 3,
    first_names = c("Rod", "Hull", "Emu"))
``` 

\noindent Components are always numbered. In the `lst` object above, we can access
individual components using the double bracket notation. For example to select
the third element from the list, we have

```{r, }
lst[[3]]
``` 

\noindent So to access the first element of the third component we
do^[The third component is `first_names`.]

```{r, }
lst[[3]][1]
``` 

\noindent The `length()` function gives the number of top level components:

```{r, }
length(lst)
``` 

\noindent Components of lists may also be named. If this is the case, then we
can also access the element using its name:

```{r, }
lst[["course"]]
lst$course
``` 

\noindent A useful function for interrogating an object is
`str()`.^[`str` is short for structure.] Using the `lst` object
as an example, we have

```{r, }
str(lst)
``` 


## Example: $t$-test

Lets go back to the $t$-test example in Section \@ref(sec:S3-1). Rather than print
the function output to the screen, we will store the output in the variable
`rst`:

```{r, }
rst = t.test(z)
``` 

\noindent The `rst` object has `r length(rst)` elements

```{r, }
length(rst)
``` 

\noindent with the following names

```{r, }
names(rst)
``` 

\noindent Using the `str()` function, we can interogate the `rst` object further

```{r, }
str(rst)
``` 

\noindent We can see that the $t$-function returns a list of nine elements. We can access
these elements in the usual way

```{r, }
rst$statistic
rst[[2]]
``` 

\noindent Being able to extract the output from functions will be very useful
when we look at more advanced statistical routines.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
votes = data.frame(Labour = c(762, 484),
  Cons = c(327, 239),
  LibDem = c(468, 477))
rownames(votes) = c("M", "F")
Xsq = chisq.test(votes)
``` 


## Example: $

Let's now return to the $\chi^2$ example from the notes. As
before, we can extract the names of individuals list components, using the
`names()` function\sidenote{I would also use the `str()` function, but to
  save space in the notes, I've omitted the output.}

```{r, }
names(Xsq)
``` 

\noindent Each component of the list contains some information from the
statistical analysis. For example, to get the $p$-value we use

```{r, }
Xsq$p.value
``` 

\noindent to retrieve the expected number of counts under the null hypothesis

```{r, }
Xsq$expected
``` 

\noindent If we were interested in which cells differed the most, we could look
at the standardised residuals

```{r, }
Xsq$stdres
``` 

\noindent This table helps to explain why we rejected the null hypotheis of no association
between gender and voting preference. It appears that more males voted Labour
and fewer voted Liberal Democrat than would have been expected if the null hypothesis
was true.
